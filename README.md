# hugo's dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.
Based on https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.

## what's inside

- some customizations for osx, git, ruby, tmux, vim, and zsh
- some tools in a brewfile

## install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/squanto/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

## bugs

If you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/squanto/dotfiles/issues) on this repository
and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

## thanks

I forked [@holmans](https://github.com/holman)'s dotfiles, who forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan's original project.


## todo
add solargraph gem, vs code config
